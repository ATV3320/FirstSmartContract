# FirstSmartContract
This is just a simple smart contract for a virtual wallet, where a guardian/owner can send money and the children/recipients can cash out.



The idea is to make a blockchain where people who use/have experienced working with free softwares online can put their ratings online on a blockchain-
and flag the softwares as good or bad.
This would help the new users about the potential vulnerabilities.
This is only the rough idea. 
Txns about this whole idea have not been thought out yet.
